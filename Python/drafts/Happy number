A number is called happy if it leads to 1 after a sequence of steps 
where in each step number is replaced by sum of squares of its digit 
that is if we start with Happy Number and keep replacing it with digits square sum, we reach 1.

For example: 7 is a happy number through the following steps:
7 -> (7^2) 
49 -> (4^2 + 9^2)
97 -> (9^2 + 7^2)
130 -> (1^2 + 0^2 + 3^2)
10 -> (1^2 +0^2)
1
